### 155. Comments:

Ensure that the code is well commented both with NatSpec and inline comments for better readability and maintainability.

The comments should accurately reflect what the corresponding code does.

Stale comments should be removed.

Discrepancies between code and comments should be addressed.

Any TODOâ€™s indicated by comments should be addressed.

Commented code should be removed.

### 156. Tests:

Tests indicate that the system implementation has been validated against the specification.

Unit tests, functional tests and integration tests should have been performed to achieve good test coverage across the entire codebase.

Any code or parameterisation used specifically for testing should be removed from production code.

### 157. Unused constructs:

Any unused imports, inherited contracts, functions, parameters, variables, modifiers, events or return values should be removed (or used appropriately) after careful evaluation.

This will not only reduce gas costs but improve readability and maintainability of the code.

### 158. Redundant constructs:

Redundant code and comments can be confusing and should be removed (or changed appropriately) after careful evaluation.

This will not only reduce gas costs but improve readability and maintainability of the code.
