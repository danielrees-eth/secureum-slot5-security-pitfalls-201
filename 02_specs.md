### 136. System specification:

Ensure that the specification of the entire system is considered, written and evaluated to the greatest detail possible.

Specification describes how (and why) the different components of the system behave to achieve the design requirements.

Without specification, a system implementation cannot be evaluated against the requirements for correctness.

### 137. System documentation:

Ensure that roles, functionalities and interactions of the entire system are well documented to the greatest detail possible.

Documentation describes what (and how) the implementation of different components of the system does to achieve the specification goals.

Without documentation, a system implementation cannot be evaluated against the specification for correctness and one will have to rely on analyzing the implementation itself.
